It focuses on expanding the service footprint (such as gaming and IoT), improving network intelligence, and utilizing cloud-native protocols to ensure that a broader population of users can be served with high quality, regardless of their location or domain. It aggregates KVIs that deal with the backend infrastructure (SCP, In-band intelligence) and the direct result of that infrastructure (increased user capacity and service reach).",
